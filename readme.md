# Book Price Scraping & Machine Learning Project

Unlock the power of real-world data scraping and predictive modeling with this end-to-end project that combines web scraping, data preprocessing, and machine learning ‚Äî all focused on predicting book prices!

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- **Scrape** dynamic, real-world data from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website using Selenium automation.
- **Clean and preprocess** raw scraped data for reliable analysis.
- **Build and evaluate** machine learning models:
  - A **Regression model** to predict book prices based on features like customer rating and availability.
  - A **Classification model** to predict stock availability (note: limited by dataset imbalance).

By working with live scraped data, this project bridges the gap between raw web data and actionable business insights through machine learning.

## Results & Insights
The regression model provides a baseline attempt to predict book prices using features like rating and stock availability. However, current results show limited predictive power, indicating room for improvement.

The classification model attempts to predict stock status, but due to the dataset containing almost exclusively in-stock samples, its accuracy is not meaningful.

Both models can be significantly enhanced with better feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and more diverse and balanced datasets.
