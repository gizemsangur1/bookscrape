# Book Price Scraping & Machine Learning Project

This is a hands-on project where I built a complete pipeline to collect real data by scraping book information from a website, clean and prepare that data, and then create machine learning models to predict book prices. It helped me practice web scraping, data preprocessing, and regression modeling ‚Äî all with a practical, end-to-end approach.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:

- **Scrape** dynamic, real-world data from the [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com/) website using Selenium automation.
- **Clean and preprocess** raw scraped data for reliable analysis.
- **Build and evaluate** machine learning models:
  - A **Regression model** to predict book prices based on features like customer rating and availability.
  - A **Classification model** to predict stock availability (note: limited by dataset imbalance).

By working with live scraped data, this project bridges the gap between raw web data and actionable business insights through machine learning.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book_price_project.git
cd book_price_project

```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```

python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

````

3. **Install dependencies**

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

````
4. **Run the pipeline**

```

python main.py

````

## Results & Insights
The regression model provides a baseline attempt to predict book prices using features like rating and stock availability. However, current results show limited predictive power, indicating room for improvement.

The classification model attempts to predict stock status, but due to the dataset containing almost exclusively in-stock samples, its accuracy is not meaningful.

Both models can be significantly enhanced with better feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and more diverse and balanced datasets.
